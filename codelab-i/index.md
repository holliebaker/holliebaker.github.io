The best way to learn to code is to... write lots of code. With that in mind, here are some ideas for exercises or projects you can work on.

## Exercises by topic

1. [Getting started](./getting-started)

    See Chapter 1 of the Codelab I repository.

2. [Logic and Conditional Statements](./conditionals)

    See Chapter 2 of the Codelab I repository.

3. [Iteration (lops)](./loops)

    See Chapter 3 of the Codelab I repository.

4. [Arrays](./arrays)

    See Chapter 4 of the Codelab I repository.

At this point, you might like to move on to some <em>bigger projects</em>. Alternatively, contiue with the topics below.

5. Functions

6. Struct

## Projects

1. See the Further Exercises section of the Codelab I repository.
1. [Ciphers](./ciphers) - implement and attempt to break some cryptographic ciphers.
1. Roguelike game - build a terminal-based game.
1. Poker Hands
1. Chatbot
1. Graph algorithms
1. Solve some Christmas-themed puzzles from [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) (previous years' exercises are also available: [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)).

    The difficulty may vary, and some of the problems might be unreasonably hard in C++.
