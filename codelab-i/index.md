The best way to learn to code is to... write lots of code. With that in mind, here are some ideas for exercises or projects you can work on.

## Exercises by topic

1. [Getting started](./getting-started)

1. [Logic and Conditional Statements](./conditionals)

1. [Iteration (loops)](./loops)

1. [Arrays](./arrays)

    At this point, you may like to move on to some <em>bigger projects</em>.

## Projects

1. [Ciphers](./ciphers) - implement and attempt to break some cryptographic ciphers.
1. Roguelike game - build a terminal-based game.
1. Graph algorithms
1. Solve some Christmas-themed puzzles from [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) (previous years' exercises are also available: [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)).

    The difficulty may vary, and some of the problems might be unreasonably hard in C++.
