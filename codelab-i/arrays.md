## Arrays

### Search and Sort

1. Start by defining an array containing 10 numbers.
1. Use a for loop to determine whether the array contains `42` (or a number of your choice, or a value entered by the user).
1. Now check whether the array is sorted in ascending order. I.e., check whether the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one.
1. Sort the array by comparing and swapping elements (figure out a method of sorting yourself, or do some research into sorting algorithms -- you may want to compare your solution with a friend, to see who can sort their array in the fewest steps).

### Version Codename Generator

There is a famous Linux distro whose codenames consist of an animal and an adjective. Write a program to generate version codenames.

1. Start by declaring two arrays, one should contain animals and the other adjectives.
1. First, output all the possible codenames: loop through the animals and, for each animal, loop through all the adjectives, printing each combination.
1. Now refine your solution: valid codenames are those where the animal and adjective both start with the same letter. Allow the user te enter the starting letter and output only the codenames corresponding to that letter.
1. Can you use a similar set-up, with two arrays, to tell knock-knock jokes?
